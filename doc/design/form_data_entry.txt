NEW ROLE: TYPIST
typist sees two lists of forms:
  1) all of their forms which have been deferred and are not invalid
  2) all forms which they have never processed, are not invalid
     and which have less than two entries

process form => NEW WIDGET: FORM_ENTRY VIEW
{
  display form and data entry widget
  disable defer button if form not previously deferred
  if( user submits form )
  {
    validate data => NEW PULL: FORM_ENTRY VALIDATE
    save entered data => NEW PUSHES: FORM_ENTRY NEW & FORM_ENTRY EDIT
    if( data not valid ) { show invalid entries }
    else // data valid
    {
      if( form has data entered from other user AND data matches ) { import data, link form }
      DONE (go back to form list)
    }
  }
  else if( user defers form ) => NEW PUSH: FORM_ENTRY DEFER
  {
    save entered data => NEW PUSHES: FORM_ENTRY NEW & FORM_ENTRY EDIT
    mark form entry as deferred
  }
}

any non-typist who has access sees two list of forms
  1) all forms which have at least two entries but not linked and are not invalid
  2) all forms which do not have at least two complete entries and are not invalid

{
  display form and data from both entries
  for every field a radio button to select which entry to accept
  submit button disabled until user selects all radio buttons
  if( submit ) => NEW PUSH: FORM EDIT
  {
    import data, link form
    return to lists
  }
  // cancel
  else { return to lists }
}

view form from list (2) => NEW WIDGET: FORM VIEW
{
  display form, invalidate button and back button
  if( invalidate form ) { mark form as invalid } => NEW PUSH: FORM EDIT
  return to lists
}
