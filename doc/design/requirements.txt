Assumptions/Questions
---------------------
  * Is the PRM responsible for DCS appointments?  In-home interview appointments?  If so what is involved?
  * How is a participant's "default" DCS site determined?  For CATI sites is it based on province?  What about Alberta? (UVic/Manitoba split)
  * How are data-sources to be handled?  Is a system required for users to import batch groups of participants?
